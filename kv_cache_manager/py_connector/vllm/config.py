    # host RAM, not VRAM. An exhausted pool blocks the task (backpressure).

    # The pool is the *concurrency* of staging: tasks hold their slots for
    # gather + the synchronous SDK transfer, so the pool size caps how many
    # tasks feed the SDK at once. At 128 (one full task) the SDK transfer
    # serializes and burst loads queue behind saves: measured -3.5% ab
    # throughput and +54% vs +65% TP2 hit throughput against a 512-block
    # pool (perf 2026-08-20, doc protocol). 1024 restores origin/main's
    # concurrency (8 full tasks) for ~896 MiB pinned host RAM per attention
    # group -- host RAM is cheap, and the old 1024-slot behaviour is what
