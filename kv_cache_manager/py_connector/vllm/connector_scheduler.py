"""Scheduler side of the connector: matching, saving orchestration, finishing.

The scheduler role owns the request ledger (``_tracked``): per-request state
that compensates for information vLLM only provides inside hooks -- the
accumulated block tables (only increments arrive after the first
allocation), the save water-mark and the save-session ledger that decides
when a finished request's blocks may be freed. Entries are created on the
request's first allocation and dropped at retirement; requests that were
never allocated are never tracked.

Two small side tables carry the external-match discipline: ``_load_failed``
(requests whose load came back invalid) and ``_load_attempted`` (requests
that spent an external allocation -- relevant for hybrid models whose load
failures cannot be reported). The worker side lives in connector_worker; both
speak the vllm_common vocabulary.
