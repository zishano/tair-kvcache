"""Per-group KV cache transfer between vLLM's paged cache and KVCM storage.

Each ``TransferGroup`` is an independent transfer unit:

* Attention groups store token-granular KV; a manager block is gathered/scattered
  through the strided Triton kernel (``batch_gather_scatter_helper``) which handles
  both the contiguous full-attention layout and the block-strided hybrid layout.
* Mamba/linear/gdn groups store per-block opaque state; a manager block maps to a
  single logical block whose raw bytes are copied verbatim.

The transport itself is layout-agnostic and **zero-VRAM**: for every manager
block we hand the SDK a ``BlockBuffer`` (a pinned CPU region) and the block's
remote URI. Save gathers HBM -> pinned host directly and ``SaveKvCaches``;
load ``LoadKvCaches`` -> pinned host, then scatters pinned -> HBM directly.
The gather/scatter kernel addresses host pinned memory over PCIe (UVA
zero-copy), and state-group copies use plain ``copy_`` between the GPU tensors
and the pinned slices -- no device-side staging buffer exists anywhere on the
data path, so the connector competes with the engine for exactly zero HBM.
